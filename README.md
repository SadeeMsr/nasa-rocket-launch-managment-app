# Nasa Rocket launcher
This app was completely focesed on applying some advance Node Js backend concepts & application techniques.So, The purpose of the app was to -

- Apply 👉🏻<b>MVC</b> pattern in the backend
- Learn how to use JavaScript testing frame-works Like 👉🏻<b>JEST</b>
- Learn how to use production process manager like 👉🏻<b>PM2</b> for Node JS to make response faster
- Learn basic github action for 👉🏻<b>CI/CD</b>
- Learn basics of 👉🏻<b>docker setups</b>. 
- Use a cool react frame-work called 👉🏻<b>arwes</b>
- Learn 👉🏻<b>Pagination</b> of large API data.
- Use keplar exo-planet data & spacex API data to search possible habitable planets.
- Apply basic <b>scripting</b> knowledge in Package.json for productions
- Apply <b>mongoDB knowledge</b> more detailed.
- Learn production level file structuring for Node JS apps.
